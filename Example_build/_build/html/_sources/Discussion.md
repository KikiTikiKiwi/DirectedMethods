# Discussion/Conclusion 
- So far, we have discussed the basic idea of the groups' glass and its properties. We have also discussed the importance of using a specific ratio for applying CNPs to achieve effective results. To find these specific ratios for very complex glass systems, we have proposed Machine Learning as a tool to help locate the glass melting parameters that could produce those ratios. However, machine learning models need data, which was the purpose of extracting the XANES spectra and performing analysis. If it needed to be clarified beforehand, to train an ML model, we needed inputs mapped to some output with which we could train the model. So extracting the concentrations of each oxidized state in a sample is ultimately the first step.
