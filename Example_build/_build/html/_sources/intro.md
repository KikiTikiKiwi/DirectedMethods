# Introduction
There is a need to create a series of bioactive glass with therapeutic nanoparticles (nanoceria) due to its ability to quench toxic radials in the body {cite}`paperOne`. These properties arise due to co-existing nanoceria in different oxidization states $Ce_2O_3(Ce^{3+})$ and $CeO_2(Ce^{4+})$ where reduction and oxidization can occur simultaneously, allowing nanoceria to act as a catalyst{cite}`KHANIN2021118150`. Our group’s overall research focuses on biomedical applications such as anti-bacterial and antioxidant due to nanocerias’ unique catalytic activities, where it is understood that cerium oxide ratios affect its use of application. To achieve the desired application, the sample of nanoceria must exist at a specific ratio of its possible oxidization states $(Ce^{3+}/Ce^{4+})$. Machine learning offers a uniqe ability to predict glass parameters required to synthesize those specific ratios of $(Ce^{3+}/Ce^{4+})$. It is therefore our goal to discuss eveything leading up to the use of a machine learning model before we dive into how one is made.
## Glass Background
The general understanding of glass is that it has no ordered structure with no uniform periodic assembly. It can be thought of as molecules frozen in place, known as an arrested state. Here the molecules are in random positions where, thermodynamically, they are not in equilibrium. In making such a material, we view the glass as a nonequilibrium disordered state of matter, such that the final form of the system may be in one of many disordered states, representative of the local free energy. The liquid (molten glass) is supercooled to ensure that crystallization does not occur. The relaxation time is very sharp, bringing the liquid below the glass transition temperature so that no crystals form. Supercooling the liquid reduces the mobility of the atoms, setting them in their final positions. The general idea of quenching creates glass, but the varying compositions or the amount of those compositions produce different types of glass. Another way of synthesis is to control the preparation of the sample, making a large number of other glasses using the same compositions {cite}`shelby`.
    
## Bio-active Glass Background 
Researchers have been able to make different types of bioactive glass with varying behaviors of dissolution. The kind that offers strong interaction with the body is called third-generation bioactive glass. Third-generation BGs break down entirely, releasing 'functional ions' - such physical mechanisms are used in the biomedical field to deliver medication. What is of particular interest is how to produce specific ratios of functional ions contained in BG glass. A general understanding of the mechanisms to make glass with targeted ratios of these ions is not well understood, as the relations are often non-monotonic and very complex {cite}`HAN2020286`. In our groups research, a Sodium Borate Bio-active Glass has been made, which fully disassociates in water, releasing the nano-ceria particles {cite}`nano12142363`.

## Data Collection: Finding the ratios
An important step is finding the $(Ce^{3+}/Ce^{4+})$ ratios of each sample. Using XANES, which stands for "X-ray Absorption Near-Edge Structure" and is the region of the XAFS graph, usually defined as 50 (eV) above the edge's energy-in this case the L3 edge of Cerium. The spectra generated is a result of hundreds of thousands of x-rays directed at a sample with definite energy. These x-rays are absorbed by the individual atoms, which we can say are in some state. The absorption excites the atom to a new state of excitation or ejects a core electron out which scatters off the surrounding atoms. Instruments then measure the intensity of the incident beam to the transmitted beam called transmisson or the flourecenece from electron ejection {cite}`XAFS,XANES`. From the XANES transmission spectrum, Linear Combination Fitting can be performed to find the valance state concentrations of each glass sample.

## Machine Learning:
The purpose of this Directed Methods course is to investigate the use of machine learning to find the parameters needed in liquid-to-glass synthesis doped with Cerium-Oxide, to produce a targeted ratio of functional ions(valance Nano-Ceria). Glass does not have a simple linear relationship, so linear Machine learning models are expected to perform poorly. The capability of machine learning models to find cause-effect correlations from experimental data will determine our ability to make accurate predictions about new data. Thus, finding a model that can handle non-linear data is imperative, connecting our input parameters to our output through found trends. A group study found that an AR-RF ML model worked best compared to Gaussian Process regression. It was reasoned that even though a powerful tool, it still needed to capture the non-linear relations between the dissolution rate of glass in a PH contacting solution {cite}`HAN2020286`. Like their research, our group works with non-monotonic relationships of glass doped with Cerium oxide to produce targeted ratios of CNP. In the past, GPR was utilized to predict specific ratios given glass melting parameters. Test data evaluated this model's performance to have an R^2 score between 0.70-0.80. Our model's relative success could result from overfitting and may be unsuitable for blind predictions of new data. It is best to have mathematical premises of non-linear data upon which our model found itself.
